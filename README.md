selenium-maven-project
======================

This project was made to allow you to get your own automated tests up and
running fast, and contains examples of JUnit4 Selenium tests designed to
run on multiple vm platforms in parallel via SauceLabs. 

It's a Maven project, so its depencies can be easily and automatically
downloaded. 

I recommend using Eclipse as your platform from which to run your JUnit tests.
Happy testing!
